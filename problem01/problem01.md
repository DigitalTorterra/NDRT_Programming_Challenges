# Problem 01

If we list all the natural numbers (integers greater than 0) below 10
that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6, and 9. The sum of these
numbers is 23.

Write a Python program that finds the sum of all the multiples of 3 or
5 below a given number, and use that program to find the sum of all
the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
